### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Since 1986, I have helped my clients - entities in the public and private sector - identify the bottlenecks in their software-based products and processes. I believe in wholesome but simple battle-tested solutions, with intense focus on the UX, DX and CX.

I run Reepolee, an out-of-the-box agency. Check us out at https://www.reepolee.com. 

And if you're ever in Slovenija, ping me. I'd love to chat  about software with you in person over a pint or a cup of coffee.
